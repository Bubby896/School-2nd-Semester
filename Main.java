    //Changes:
    //Changed the name of the file to match the class
    //Added a "public static void main(String args[]) {} so that the code could run"
    //Made the "For" in one of the loops lowercase
    //Replaced a colon in a loop with a semicolon
    //Replaced an 'm' with an 'n' for a print statement
    //Capitalized 'system' in a print statement
    //Moved the if else statement into the for loop so it could use the i variable
    //Switched the direction of the greater than sign for the for loop so it works
    //Changed some print statements to println for read-ability
    //Added some gaps to the output for read-ability
    //Small grammatical :)
